setup-environment
=================

Personal setup environment for git and latex.

### git
Contains code to add to your .bashrc file in to create a pretty prompt when you're in a git repo.  Also contains some useful git options.

### latex
Contains latex boilerplate to get a quick document going.
@todo: add useful commands in separate file
