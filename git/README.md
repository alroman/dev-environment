## Git commit messages

Idea is to promote better communication between developers, seed up the reviewing process and get a good looking git log.  Your git commit message should be easy to read and effectively commmunicate what your code changes do.  

The format should be as follows:

    CCLE-1234 - one line description of what your commit does 

    a more detailed description of what your commit does.  some justification for your choice solution
